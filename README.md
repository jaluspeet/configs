If you want to be as cool as me: with `stow` installed, just do `./deploy.sh`.
It will symlink every config file in here to where it belongs (in your home directory).

## note
`Alacritty` doesn't get symlinked and if you want also that you should copy `.config/alacritty/alacritty.toml` manually to the same path in your home. 
The reason for this is that i like different font sizes depending on how big the monitor I am using is, so it doesn't make sense to have also the font size synced.
